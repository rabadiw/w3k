A framework should be an extension to an application and modularize the components of the applications. Thus, a solution should be able to evolve independentily of the framework and/or easily extend/change its modules.

The only core dependency of the framework should be it's modular core. Through the core, the application inherits capabilities and disable/remove unnecessary components. Only through interfaces should a solutions create cohesion.
